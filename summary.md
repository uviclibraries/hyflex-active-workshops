# Teaching Tips:

### TL;DR Teaching Tips
- **Workshop Welcome**: Before the workshop starts Greet as many workshop participants as possible asking the two questions below. If the group is larger greet as many as possible and then no later than 2 minutes past the start time ask those you couldn't greet personally to answer the questions below in the chat for you to look at after you finishing the workshop introduction:
  - Which faculty or department are you from on campus?
  - What is one thing they hope to get out of the workshop?
- **Share Screen**: After you finished the workshop introduction talk through how participants can share their screen with you and any co-hosts and no one else.
- **Follow up Individually**: If there are 15 or less participats in the workshop follow up with each particiant individually to see if they need any assistance rather than asking the group if anyone needs assistance. People are much more likely to ask for help if you say, "__**Rich, how are you doing? Do you have any questions or would like help with anything?**__". If there are more than 15 people, then ask people
- **You See someone struggling**: If you see someone who is sharing their screen struggling what should you do?
  - If they are struggling with a common problem, it's likely that others who are not sharing their screens are experiencing the same problem.

### Teaching Tips in More Detail:
7. **Active Learning NOT Lecturing!** Don't forget that one of your main goals should be to get learners working on practical activities as quickly as possible, which means that you shouldn't be lecturing for more than 15% to 25% of the run time for a workshop. Participants will remember much more from the hands-on activities than from a lecture.
7. **Be Excited!** Instructors who are excited about what they are teaching are typically more effective in helping their students to learn than non-excited teachers. An instructor’s excitement can be infectious.
8. **What's the Big Idea**: What is the big idea that will capture the imagination of your learners at the start of your face-to-face session?
9. **Guide on the Side**: Lead the workshop as a “Guide on the Side” rather than lecturing like a “Sage on the Stage.” Put as much instructional material as possible into the pre-workshop videos so that the majority of the face-to-face time can be used for hands-on learning.
10. **Workshop Introductions**: At the beginning of the workshop (or even better if you can before the workshop start time), introduce yourself and ask participants to do the same. It can be helpful knowing the background of participants, as well as what they hope to get out of the workshop so you as an instructor can customize the workshop on the fly to best meet the needs of participants. Here are some sample prompts: 
  - Which faculty or department are you from on campus?
  - What is one thing they hope to get out of the workshop?
11. **Make workshop activities directly relevant**: Allow participants to work at their own pace & to choose the activities they want to complete so that participants can get out of it what they need or want. No forced march through the curriculum!
12. **Positive Feedback**: Give positive feedback to participants as often as you can. This is particularly important for learners who are struggling, or in introductory workshops where learners are still mastering the basics.  Positive feedback for novices is a much more effective motivator than critiques or negative feedback.
